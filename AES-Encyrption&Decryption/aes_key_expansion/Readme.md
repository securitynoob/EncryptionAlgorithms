# AES Key Expansion

AES key expansion uses a `g(.)` function that performs the following operations on a given word:
    
- **Rotate:** takes a 4-byte word and rotates everything one byte to the left, e.g. rotate([1,2,3,4]) → [2, 3, 4, 1]
- **SubBytes:** each byte of a word is substituted with the value in the S-Box whose index is the value of the original byte
- **Rcon:** the first byte of a word is XORed with the round constant. Each value of the Rcon table is a member of the Rinjdael finite field.

**Exercise:** Implement `g()` to perform the above operations on a given word based on the round number $i$



```python
# takes 4-byte word and iteration number
def g(input_word, i):
    
    # get the RCON array
    rcon = get_rcon()
    
    # Get the SBOX
    sbox = get_sbox()
    
    # rotate word 1 byte to the left
    word = rotate(input_word,1)
    
    # make an byte array with the length of word
    new_word = bytearray(len(word))
    
    # apply sbox substitution on all bytes of word
    for k in range(len(input_word)):
        new_word[k] = sbox[word[k]]
    
    # XOR the output of the rcon[i] transformation with the first part
    # of the word
    new_word[0] = new_word[0]^rcon[i]
    
    return new_word
```

print('Sanity Check(g): ', test_g(g))
```

## Expanding a 128-bit key
Expanding a 128-bit key uses an array with 176 bytes as follows:
1. The first 16 bytes of the expanded key are simply the encryption key
2. The rcon iteration value i is set to 0

Until we have 176 bytes of expanded key, we do the following to generate 16 more bytes of expanded key:

   1. We do the following to create the first four bytes of expanded key:
      - We create a 4-byte temporary variable, $t$
      - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to $t$
      - We perform `g()` (see above) on $t$, with $i$ as the rcon iteration value.
      - We increment $i$ by one.
      - We exclusive-or $t$ with the four-byte block 16 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 
   2. We then do the following three times to create the next twelve bytes of expanded key:
      - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to $t$
      - We exclusive-or $t$ with the four-byte block 16 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 



```python
def expand_key_128(initial_key):
    
    # initialize expanded_key with a size of the intial 
    expanded_key = bytearray(len(initial_key))
    
    # copy initial key to expanded key
    expanded_key = initial_key
    
    
    # set Rcon iterator to 0
    i = 0
    
    # make a temporary bytearray with the size of a word (representing t) 
    temp = bytearray(4)  # 4-byte container for temp storage
    
    while len(expanded_key) < 176:
        
        # temp → last 4 bytes of expandedKey
        temp = expanded_key[len(expanded_key)-4:]

        # every 16 bytes apply core schedule to temp
        if len(expanded_key)% 16 == 0:
            # apply g()
            temp = g(temp,i)
            
            #increament i
            i =  i + 1

        
        # XOR temp with the 4-byte block 16 bytes before the end of the current expanded key.
        # These 4 bytes become the next bytes in the expanded key
        # NOTE: xor is note defined on the bytearray, you need to perform xor on each element on temp
        # and add it to expanded_key
        block = expanded_key[len(expanded_key)-16:len(expanded_key)-12]
        for j in range(4):
            t = temp[j]^block[j]
            expanded_key.append(t)
            
    return expanded_key
                           
```


```python
print('Sanity Check (expand_key_128): ', test_expanded_key_128(expand_key_128))
```

    Sanity Check (expand_key_128):  True
    

## Expanding a 192-bit key
This is almost identical to a 128-bit key schedule:

1. The first 24 bytes of the expanded key are simply the encryption key
2. The rcon iteration value i is set to 0

Until we have 208 bytes of expanded key, we do the following to generate 24 more bytes of expanded key:
   1. We do the following to create the first four bytes of expanded key:
        - We create a 4-byte temporary variable, t
        - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to t
        - We perform schedule_core (see above) on t, with i as the rcon iteration value.
        - We increment i by one.
        - We exclusive-or t with the four-byte block 24 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 
   2. We then do the following five times to create the next 20 bytes of expanded key:
        - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to t
        - We exclusive-or t with the four-byte block 24 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 

We now have 208 bytes of expanded key generated. 


```python
def expand_key_192(initial_key):
    
     # initialize expanded_key with a size of the intial 
    expanded_key = bytearray(len(initial_key))
    
    # copy initial key to expanded key
    expanded_key = initial_key
    
    
    # set Rcon iterator to 0
    i = 0
    
    # make a temporary bytearray with the size of a word (representing t) 
    temp = bytearray(4)  # 4-byte container for temp storage
    
    while len(expanded_key) < 208:
        
        # temp → last 4 bytes of expandedKey
        temp = expanded_key[len(expanded_key)-4:]

    
        if len(expanded_key)%24 == 0:
            # apply g()
            temp = g(temp,i)
            
            #increament i
            i =  i + 1

        
        block = expanded_key[len(expanded_key)-24:len(expanded_key)-20]
        for j in range(4):
            t = temp[j]^block[j]
            expanded_key.append(t)
            
    return expanded_key
      
```


```python
print('Sanity Check (expand_key_192): ', test_expanded_key_192(expand_key_192))
```

    Sanity Check (expand_key_192):  True
    

## Expanding a 256-bit key
This is similar to the 128-bit and 192-bit key schedule, but includes an extra application of the s-box.

1. The first 32 bytes of the expanded key are simply the encryption key
2. The rcon iteration value i is set to 0

Until we have 240 bytes of expanded key, we do the following to generate 32 more bytes of expanded key:
   1. We do the following to create the first four bytes of expanded key:
        - We create a 4-byte temporary variable, t
        - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to t
        - We perform schedule_core (see above) on t, with i as the rcon iteration value.
        - We increment i by one.
        - We exclusive-or t with the four-byte block 32 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 
   2. We then do the following three times to create the next twelve bytes of expanded key:
        - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to t
        - We exclusive-or t with the four-byte block 32 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 
   3. We then do the following to create the next four bytes of expanded key:
        - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to t
        - We run each of the four bytes in t through Rijndael's S-box
        - We exclusive-or t with the four-byte block 32 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 
   4. We then do the following three times to create the next twelve bytes of expanded key:
        - We assign the value of the previous four bytes in the temporary key to t
        - We exclusive-or t with the four-byte block 32 bytes before the new expanded key. This becomes the next four bytes in the expanded key. 

We now have 240 bytes of expanded key generated.
